# GDOpenServer
Basically a "server emulator" for Geometry Dash.


### Setup (extremely simplified)
1. Upload all files to your webserver
2. Import the database into an existing MySQL database
3. Configurate files in /config
4. Edit the links in the application (some links are encoded in Base64 since update 2.1)
