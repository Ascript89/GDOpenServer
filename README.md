# GDOpenServer
Basically a "server emulator" for Geometry Dash, except it's rewritten now.

### WARNING
There haven't been made lots of tests so far, and it's currently still under development.
I advise you to not use this for a public server until a release will be pushed.
Currently, tests are done on a Linux server, with MariaDB and PHP 7.3 installed.

### Setup (extremely simplified)
1. Upload all files to your webserver
2. Import the database into an existing MySQL database
3. Configurate files in /config
4. Edit the links in the application (some links are encoded in Base64 since update 2.1)
